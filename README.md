# Private message sharing for ETH2 validators

## Using this Project

### Setup

1. Clone this repository `git clone {this repository}` _#TODO fill in repo address_
2. install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build with `npm run build`.

### Run Contract Tests

In one terminal run `npx hardhat node`

Then in another run `npm run test`

Notes:

- The gas usage table may be incomplete (the gas report currently needs to run with the `--network localhost` flag; see below).

### Run Contract Tests and Generate Gas Usage Report

In one terminal run `npx hardhat node`

Then in another run `npm run test -- --network localhost`

Notes:

- When running with this `localhost` option, you get a gas report but may not get good callstacks
- See [here](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter#installation-and-config) for how to configure the gas usage report.

### Run Coverage Report for Tests

`npm run coverage`

Notes:

- running a coverage report currently deletes artifacts, so after each coverage run you will then need to run `npx hardhat clean` followed by `npm run build` before re-running tests
- the branch coverage is 75%

### Deploy to the Ethereum Rinkeby test network

Create/modify network config in `hardhat.config.ts` and add API key and private key, then run:

`npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.ts`

### Verify on Etherscan

Using the [hardhat-etherscan plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html), add Etherscan API key to `hardhat.config.ts`, then run:

`npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby <DEPLOYED ADDRESS>`
